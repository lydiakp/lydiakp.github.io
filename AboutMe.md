I am a current student at Michigan Tech, currently pursuing a major in Data Science. Some of my skills include java and javaScript. I am looking forward to learning more languages and further exploring the possiblities that Data Science offers. While not searching for an internship or a job, I will be in the future. Outside of acedmecics I enjoy reading, playing music, and being outside.
